#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Created by Simon Camacho on
# July 24, 2020. Quick Note 
# is an application to save little
# memories for the user which can
# then be reported back at any point
# 
# @version 1.0.0: July 24, 2020
# Added basic functionality, add_memory
# clear_memories, list_memories, get_help
# and info methods.
